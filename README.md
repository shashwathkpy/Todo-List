# Todo-List
The Odin Project: JavaScript Todo List

This Todo List can be used to create projects, and those projects can be used to create tasks.
A task has several properties including a title, description, date to complete, and a priority value.
Tasks can be checked off when completed.
The Todo List implements localStorage, so your previous work is saved on your device.
